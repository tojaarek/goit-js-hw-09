# Task 1 - color switcher

Do this task in the 01-color-switcher.html and 01-color-switcher.js files.

In HTML, there are "Start" and "Stop" buttons.

```
<button type="button" data-start>Start</button>
<button type="button" data-stop>Stop</button>
```

Write a script that, after clicking the "Start" button, changes the < body >
background color once a second to a random value using the inline style. When
clicking on the "Stop" button, background color change must stop.

ATENTION

Please note that the «Start» button can be clicked an infinite number of times.
Make sure that the «Start» button is disabled while the theme change is running.

Use the getRandomHexColor function to generate a random color.

```
function getRandomHexColor() {
  return `#${Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777215).toString(16).padStart(6, 0)}`;
}
```

# Task 2 - countdown timer

Do this task in the 02-timer.html and 02-timer.js files. Write a timer script
that counts down to a specific date. Such a timer can be used in blogs and
online stores, event-logging pages, during maintenance, etc.

## Interface elements

In HTML, there is ready-made markup for the timer, end date selection field and
a button that should trigger the timer when clicked. Add at least some
decoration to the interface elements.

```
<input type="text" id="datetime-picker" />
<button type="button" data-start>Start</button>

<div class="timer">
  <div class="field">
    <span class="value" data-days>00</span>
    <span class="label">Days</span>
  </div>
  <div class="field">
    <span class="value" data-hours>00</span>
    <span class="label">Hours</span>
  </div>
  <div class="field">
    <span class="value" data-minutes>00</span>
    <span class="label">Minutes</span>
  </div>
  <div class="field">
    <span class="value" data-seconds>00</span>
    <span class="label">Seconds</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

## flatpickr library

Use the flatpickr library to allow cross-browser selection of the end date and
time in a single UI element. In order to add the CSS code of the library to the
project, you need to add one more import, aside from the one described in the
documentation.

```
// Described in documentation
import flatpickr from "flatpickr";
// Additional styles import
import "flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.min.css";
```

The library expects to be initialized on the input type="text" element, so there
is an input datetime-picker field added to the HTML document.

```
<input type="text" id="datetime-picker" />
```

An optional parameter object can be passed as the second argument to the
flatpickr(selector, options) function. We have prepared an object for you that
you need to complete the task. Find about the role of each property in the
Options documentation and use it in your code.

```
const options = {
  enableTime: true,
  time_24hr: true,
  defaultDate: new Date(),
  minuteIncrement: 1,
  onClose(selectedDates) {
    console.log(selectedDates[0]);
  },
};
```

## Date selection

The onClose() method is called from the parameter object every time the
interface element that creates flatpickr is closed. It should be used to handle
the date selected by the user. The selectedDates parameter is an array of the
selected dates, so the first element is taken.

- If the user selects a date from the past, show window.alert() with the text
  "Please choose a date in the future".
- If the user has selected a valid date (in the future), the "Start" button
  becomes active.
- The "Start" button must be inactive until the user has selected a date in the
  future.
- When you click the "Start" button, the countdown to the selected date starts
  from the time of clicking.

## Countdown

When you click on the "Start" button, the script must calculate once a second
how much time is left until the specified date and update the timer interface,
showing four numbers: days, hours, minutes and seconds in the following format:
xx:xx:xx:xx.

- The number of days can be more than two digits.
- The timer must stop when it reaches the end date, that is, 00:00:00:00.

LET'S NOT COMPLICATE THINGS

If the timer is running, in order to select a new date and restart it, you need
to reload the page.

To calculate the values, use the ready-made function, convertMs, where ms is the
difference between the end and current date in milliseconds.

```
function convertMs(ms) {
  // Number of milliseconds per unit of time
  const second = 1000;
  const minute = second * 60;
  const hour = minute * 60;
  const day = hour * 24;

  // Remaining days
  const days = Math.floor(ms / day);
  // Remaining hours
  const hours = Math.floor((ms % day) / hour);
  // Remaining minutes
  const minutes = Math.floor(((ms % day) % hour) / minute);
  // Remaining seconds
  const seconds = Math.floor((((ms % day) % hour) % minute) / second);

  return { days, hours, minutes, seconds };
}


console.log(convertMs(2000)); // {days: 0, hours: 0, minutes: 0, seconds: 2}
console.log(convertMs(140000)); // {days: 0, hours: 0, minutes: 2, seconds: 20}
console.log(convertMs(24140000)); // {days: 0, hours: 6 minutes: 42, seconds: 20}
```

## Time formatting

The convertMs() function returns an object with the calculated time remaining
until the end date. Note that it does not format the result. That is, if there
are 4 minutes (or any other time unit) left, the function will return 4, not 04.
In the timer interface, you need to add 0 if there are less than two digits in
the number. Write an addLeadingZero(value) function that uses the padStart()
method and format the value before rendering the interface.

## Notification library

ATTENTION

The following features are optional, but they will be a good additional
practice.

Use the notiflix library to display notifications to the user instead of
window.alert().

# Task 3 - promise generator

Do this task in the 03-promises.html and 03-promises.js files.

In HTML, there is form markup; in its fields, the user will enter the first
delay in milliseconds, the delay increment for each promise after the first one
and the number of promises to be created.

```
<form class="form">
  <label>
    First delay (ms)
    <input type="number" name="delay" required />
  </label>
  <label>
    Delay step (ms)
    <input type="number" name="step" required />
  </label>
  <label>
    Amount
    <input type="number" name="amount" required />
  </label>
  <button type="submit">Create promises</button>
</form>
```

Write a script that, when submitting the form, calls the createPromise(position,
delay) function as many times as you entered in the amount field. On each call,
pass it the number of the promise to be created (position) and the delay given
the first delay (delay) and step (step) entered by the user.

```
function createPromise(position, delay) {
  const shouldResolve = Math.random() > 0.3;
  if (shouldResolve) {
    // Fulfill
  } else {
    // Reject
  }
}
```

Supplement the code of the createPromise function so that it returns one promise
that will be fulfilled or rejected after delay time. The value of the promise
must be an object containing the position and delay properties with the values
of these parameters. Use the initial function code to choose whether to fulfill
or reject the promise.

```
createPromise(2, 1500)
  .then(({ position, delay }) => {
    console.log(`✅ Fulfilled promise ${position} in ${delay}ms`);
  })
  .catch(({ position, delay }) => {
    console.log(`❌ Rejected promise ${position} in ${delay}ms`);
  });
```
